* Preamble
%\label{section:introduction}%

%\lettrine{O}{nce}% upon a time there was a computer scientist called Mona Dorothee living in the beautiful land of functional programming.
The land of functional programming was divided into several kingdoms.
Mona lived in the kingdom of Haskell, a land where all citizens used the pure lazy functional programming language Haskell.

Mona was pursuing her PhD when one day, her adviser told her about the magical kingdom of Coq.
In the magical kingdom of Coq, all citizens used the dependently typed programming language Coq.
With Coq, the citizens were not only able to write functional programs but also to formally prove properties about these programs.

Mona was fascinated by the idea of proving properties about programs.
While her colleagues in the department of software engineering were still writing tests and hoped to catch all bugs that way, she could once and for all prove that her programs were correct.
Mona's adviser suggested to her to visit a befriended department where she could stay for a semester.
With her good intentions at heart, our hero set out to the kingdom of Coq to learn more about the Coq programming language.

Soon after Mona  got to the kingdom of Coq she realized that proving statements about programs came at a price in Coq.
In Coq, all functions have to be provably total.
Most of the citizens in the kingdom of Haskell, however, did not care about totality as they were used to work with partial functions.
Therefore, Mona could not simply use the Haskell programs she had one-to-one in Coq.

Our hero went to the largest library in the kingdom of Coq and consulted many %books\footnote{In Mona's days the term book was used as a synonym for all kinds of scientific references, not only for actual books.}%
written by wise women and men from the entire land of functional programming.
The first book she found was written by %\cite{breitner2018ready}%.
In this book, the authors proved statements about Haskell programs in Coq.
They transformed Haskell programs into Coq programs by keeping as much of the structure of the Haskell programs as possible.
In order to model partial functions they added an opaque constant [default : A] for every non-empty type [A].
By means of this constant they defined a function [error : String -> A] that was used to model the corresponding Haskell function.
Because [default] is opaque, the concrete value of [default] cannot be used in any proofs.

While Mona really liked the book by %\citeauthor*{breitner2018ready}%, they could not reason about partial values and, thus, about the strictness of an implementation.
Furthermore, she found books that emphasized the importance of considering partial values.
For example, in a book by %\cite{johann2004free}% she read about the [destroy]/[unfoldr] rule as presented by %\cite{svenningsson2002shortcut}%.
This rule fuses a list consumer with a list producer.
The [destroy]/[unfoldr] rule does not hold if partial values are considered and a strict evaluation primitive like %\texttt{seq}% is available.
Moreover, partial functions are often necessary in the implementation of data structures, whose invariants cannot be encoded in Haskell's type system.
For example, a function might be undefined for an empty list but an invariant states that the argument will never be an empty list.

Mona also read a book by %\cite{danielsson2006fast}% about relating the total interpretation of a function with an interpretation of the same function that models partiality.
In essence, when the function is only applied to total arguments, the two interpretations behave the same.
While Mona saw the importance of this connection ,the approach was still not able to argue about partial functions.
For example, it was not sufficient that a program transformation held for all total arguments, if the compiler could not enforce that the arguments are always total.

Mona did not give up.
There had to be a way to get the best of both worlds.
That is, argue about a Haskell function with respect to total values whenever possible and argue about partial values only if necessary.
Mona went to the largest library in the whole land of functional programming.
And indeed she found a book by %\cite{abel2005verifying}% that discussed exactly the problem she was trying to solve.
%\citeauthor*{abel2005verifying}% lived in the nearby magical kingdom of Agda, where dependently typed programming was also highly regarded by its citizens.
%\citeauthor*{abel2005verifying}% presented an approach to translate Haskell programs into monadic Agda programs.
By instantiating the monadic program with a concrete monad instance one could choose the model a statement should be proven in.
For example, if Mona chose the identity monad, she would work in a total world while the maybe monad allowed her to argue about partiality.
Furthermore, she would not have to make any changes to her program but could argue about the same program regardless of the monad she chose.

%\citeauthor*{abel2005verifying}% used monadic expressions to model possibly undefined expressions.
As Haskell is non-strict, a data structure may contain an undefined expression that is never demanded.
For example, a cons may have an undefined tail.
Mona eagerly defined the following inductive data type for lists in Coq, which resembled the corresponding definition by %\citeauthor*{abel2005verifying}% in Agda.%\footnote{Coq uses GADT-style data type definitions.}
 *)

Fail Inductive List M A :=
| nil : List M A
| cons : M A -> M (List M A) -> List M A.

(**
In Coq, all arguments of a type or function can be annotated: values as well as types.
As a Haskell programmer, Mona was not used to annotate type variables with their types, so she used the code convention that type variables would not be annotated, if they could be inferred --- just like she was used to in her Haskell programs.
That is, Mona could use [M : Type -> Type] and [A : Type] in the definition of [List], but these annotations were inferred by the system, so she left them out.
Moreover, she used the convention that constructors start with a lower-case letter.

When Mona tried to compile the definition of [List] in a current version of Coq, she was quite disappointed.
As indicated by the keyword [Fail], the Coq compiler accepted the definition [List] only if it caused an error.
In Mona's case, the Coq compiler presented the following error message.

%\begin{quote}
The command has indeed failed with message:\\
Non-strictly positive occurrence of \enquote{\coqdocvar{List}} in \enquote{\coqdocvar{M A} $\rightarrow$ \coqdocvar{M (List M A)} $\rightarrow$ \coqdocvar{List M A}}.
\end{quote}%

Mona thought that she had made a mistake when translating the Agda definition to Coq.
She wrote a letter to a friend in the kingdom of Agda.
A few days later she received an unexpected answer: the definition did not work in Agda either.
At the time the book by %\cite{abel2005verifying}% was written, the rules in the kingdom of Agda were less strict, but that was a long time ago.
Meanwhile, the king of the kingdom of Agda had realized that the rules needed to be changed.
The programs that could be defined using the old rules were not safe!
Following the example of the magical kingdom of Coq, non-strictly positive occurrences as mentioned in the error message above were now disallowed in the kingdom of Agda as well.

In this story, we will follow Mona Dorothee on her journey to find a model for Haskell programs in Coq that obeys the king's rules.
We will learn the laws of the kingdom of Coq from the perspective of a programmer from the kingdom of Haskell.
Mona will also meet fellows with an interest in  more theoretical aspects of functional programs and approaches for generic programming in Haskell.
On the way to achieve her goal, there are many obstacles to overcome.
Led by her curiosity and her perseverance, reading a lot of books and meeting with her fellows will ultimately give our hero the inspiration how to tackle her problem.

* The Problem
%\label{section:the-problem}%

%\lettrine{M}{ona}% spent the next days searching for books about possible adaptations of the approach by %\cite{abel2005verifying}% that worked in a current version of Coq.
Nothing came up, but Mona did not want to give up.
Thus, she used her most powerful weapon in defeating scientific obstacles: her perseverance.
She tried multiple simplified versions of data type definitions similar to [List] and checked for each whether the error still occurred.
The simplest data type definition she found that caused the same error looked as follows.%\footnote{The type \coqdocvar{nat} is the type of Peano numbers in Coq.}%

*)

Fail Inductive NonStrictlyPos := con : (NonStrictlyPos -> nat) -> NonStrictlyPos.

(**

%\noindent% When Mona compiled this definition, she got the following error message.

%\begin{quote}
The command has indeed failed with message:\\
Non-strictly positive occurrence of \enquote{\coqdocvar{NonStrictlyPos}} in \enquote{\coqdocvar{(NonStrictlyPos} $\rightarrow$ nat) $\rightarrow$ \coqdocvar{NonStrictlyPos}}.
\end{quote}%

So Mona wondered what it meant that [NonStrictlyPos] occurs in a non-strictly positive way
in the type signature of [con : (NonStrictlyPos -> nat) -> NonStrictlyPos].
Mona remembered hearing about a class of Adam Chlipala explaining the intricacies of Coq very well.
She looked up the term %\enquote{strictly positive}% and indeed found the relevant note in %\citeauthor*{chlipala2011certified}%'s book %\autocite{chlipala2011certified}%.

%\begin{quote}
We have run afoul of the strict positivity requirement for inductive definitions, which says that the type being defined may not occur to the left of an arrow in the type of a constructor argument.
\end{quote}%

An inductive type like [NonStrictlyPos] obeys the strict positivity requirement, if its recursive occurrences are strictly positive in the types of all arguments of its constructors.
Mona realized that the important part of the definition was that she needed to check the types of all arguments of a constructor and not the type of the constructor itself.
Here, the inductive type has only one constructor [con] and this constructor has only one argument of type [NonStrictlyPos -> nat].
A type [tau] occurs strictly positively in a type [tau__1 -> ... -> tau__n -> tau] if and only if [tau] does not occur in any of the types [tau__i] with %$i$% ranging from %$1$% to %$n$%.
Mona took another look at the malicious definition and understood.
The type [NonStrictlyPos] occurs non-strictly positively in one of its argument types, namely in [NonStrictlyPos -> nat].
The recursive occurrence of the type [NonStrictlyPos] is %\enquote{left of an arrow}%.
In other words [NonStrictlyPos] occurs as an argument type of [NonStrictlyPos -> nat], which makes [NonStrictlyPos] a non-strictly positive type.
In contrast, the following definition is not problematic.

*)

Inductive StrictlyPos := con : StrictlyPos -> (nat -> StrictlyPos) -> StrictlyPos.

(**
The first argument of [con] of type [StrictlyPos] is not problematic as it is trivially strictly positive.
In the second argument of [con], [StrictlyPos] does not occur to the left of an arrow in the type [nat -> StrictlyPos].
That is, as [StrictlyPos] occurs strictly positively in all arguments of the constructor [con], it fulfills the strict positivity requirement.

Mona still wondered why the king disallowed a definition like [NonStrictlyPos] in Coq.
At lunch the next day, she talked about her insights with some PhD students.
One of them had read about restrictions of dependently typed languages and explained to her that while the definition itself did not cause any trouble, it is possible to define functions that cause trouble.
Back at Mona's computer, they tried to understand the restriction given the following innocent looking function in Coq assuming that the above definition of [NonStrictlyPos] was accepted.
[[
Definition applyFun (t : NonStrictlyPos) : nat :=
  match t with
  | con f => f t
  end.
]]
The function [applyFun] simply took a value of type [NonStrictlyPos] and applied the function inside the argument of [con] to the value itself.
A problematic example usage of this function is the expression [applyFun   (con applyFun)].
Reducing the expression by using the definition of [applyFun] yields [applyFun (con applyFun)] again, which indicates that this expression will not terminate.

Mona now remembered something she learned in her first course about functional programming in Haskell, namely the following data type.

*)

Fail Inductive Mu A := mu : (Mu A -> A) -> Mu A.

(**

%\noindent% This data type can be used to implement a fix-point combinator without explicit recursion.
Before her colleague left to prepare his next tutoring class, he suggested her to consult a book by %\cite{mcadam1997wraps}% to refresh her memory about the [Mu] data type.
If Coq allows a data type like [Mu], all of the sudden general recursion is available and the corresponding logic becomes inconsistent.
Thus, a data type definition that has recursive occurrences to the left of an arrow as in [Mu] and [NonStrictlyPos] are not allowed.
When %\citeauthor*{abel2005verifying}% published their work, Agda did not perform any termination checks and, as a consequence, did not check the strict positivity requirement.

While Mona now understood why the data type as defined by %\citeauthor*{abel2005verifying}% is not allowed, it was still not obvious to her why the restriction is violated in the case of [List].
For example, if she explicitly used the maybe monad for [M], everything worked fine.
She thought about all the different monad instances she learned in class.
Then she remembered the continuation monad and realized that an arbitrary type constructor [M] might violate the restriction.
More concretely, she considered the following definition of the continuation data type.

*)

Definition Cont R A := (A -> R) -> R.

(**

%\noindent% When she instantiated [M] in the definition of [List] with [Cont], she got the following type that violated the strict positivity requirement.

*)

Fail Inductive ListC R A :=
| nilC : ListC R A
| consC : ((A -> R) -> R) -> ((ListC R A -> R) -> R) -> ListC R A.

(**

The definition of [consC] is more delicate than the definitions before.
Here, [ListC] occurs non-strictly positive in the second argument of the constructor [consC], namely [(ListC R A -> R) -> R].
Mona's colleague referred her to a book by %\cite{coquand1990inductively}% that introduced the restriction to forbid non-strictly positive types in the kingdom of Coq.
He also brought to her attention that technically, while it was not, the type [ListC] could be allowed in Agda.
In Agda only types with recursive occurrences in negative positions have to be disallowed.
Negative positions are positions left to an odd number of arrows.
For example, the definition of [NonStrictlyPos] cannot be allowed because the recursive occurrence in [NonStrictlyPos -> nat] is left of one arrow.
Just as the definition of [Mu] cannot be allowed in Agda either because the recursive occurrence in [Mu A -> A] is left of one arrow.
In contrast the recursive occurrence in [(ListC R A -> R) -> R] is left of two arrows and, therefore, could be allowed in Agda.
Coq has to be more restrictive because the sort [Prop] is impredicative while it is predicative in Agda%~\autocite{coquand2013positive}%.

In summary, the type constructor [List] defined above allows arbitrary type constructors as instances of [M].
That is, it is not safe to use this definition for all potential instantiations of [M].
The restriction might be violated for a concrete instantiation, like for example [Cont] as used in [ListC].
Since it cannot be guaranteed by definition that this data type declaration is used safely, Coq rejects the declaration.


* The Solution
%\label{section:free-monads}%

%\lettrine{M}{ona}% realized that she could not use a type variable in the definition of the monadic list data type, and, thus, had to use a concrete data type.
However, she would still like to model several different monad instances in order to be able to reason about several different possible effects.

%\subsection*{Free Monads}%
%\label{subsection:free}%

Mona was a regular reader of the %\emph{Haskell Weekly News}%, a gazette where citizens of the kingdom of Haskell presented usages and developments of the Haskell programming language.
She remembered a lot of stories about monadic abstractions and in particular about the free monad.
The free monad turns any functor into a monad and is usually defined as a data type with two constructors, [pure] and [impure].
Mona could use the concrete data type definition of a free monad to represent the monadic part in the problematic list definition.
Eager to try out this idea, Mona defined the following data type, where the type variable [F] needs to be a functor to make [Free F] a monad.

*)

Fail Inductive Free F A :=
| pure : A -> Free F A
| impure : F (Free F A) -> Free F A.

(**

Again, Coq rejected the definition of this data type.
In the constructor [impure] the type variable [F] is applied to [Free F A] and, thus, is violating the aforementioned strict positivity requirement.
Mona was disappointed that she could not apply the idea to represent the monadic part of the list definition via the free monad to her problem.
As she was still a Haskell programmer with all her heart and the free monad was known to have various applications in functional programming, she continued to study free monads as a distraction of her current setback.

As Mona was mainly looking for a way to represent the identity and the maybe monad, she checked how these monads can be represented by instances of [Free].
She found the corresponding definitions in a book that mentioned free monads, written by %\cite{swierstra2008data}%.
The identity monad corresponds to a free monad without the [impure] case, because the identity monad does not have any effect.
That is, in order to model the identity monad, Mona needed a functor that had no inhabitants.
This way, it was not possible to construct an impure value.
Mona defined the following Coq data type that has no inhabitants.

*)

Inductive Void := .

(**

%\noindent% Based on this definition Mona defined the following functor to model an instance of the free monad without impure values.

*)

Definition Zero (A : Type) := Void.

(**
%\noindent% Since the type variable [A] did not occur on the right-hand side of this definition, Mona had to actually annotate the sort in order to compile the definition in Coq.

In the case of the maybe monad there is an effect, namely the absence of a value, represented by the constructor [Nothing].
That is, Mona searched for a functor such that the [impure] constructor models the [Nothing] constructor.
Therefore, she needed a type constructor that has a single constructor but does not contain any value, such that the recursive occurrence of [Free F A] was not used.
She defined a functor with a single value by means of the data type [unit], which contains a single value called [tt].

*)

Definition One (A : Type) := unit.

(**

At first Mona was mainly interested in the identity and the maybe monad --- because %\cite{abel2005verifying}% also considered these effects to model Haskell programs.
However, when she checked out other definitions, she realized that using the free monad opens the door to model a variety of different monads.
For example, the error monad could be modeled by using the following functor.

*)

Inductive Const (B A : Type) := const : B -> Const B A.

(**

Mona had fun trying out various functors and checking what monad corresponded to the resulting instance of the free monad.
However, after a while the excitement vanished and Mona was kind of disappointed.
It felt as if she had not gained much by using a free monad.
Then, Mona suddenly had an insight.
By using a free monad she had gained one crucial advantage: she would be able to represent strictly positive monads if she was able to represent strictly positive functors.

Motivated by this insight, she gained new impulse.
She got in contact with a group of wise women and men in the area of verification stating her problem concerning Coq's restriction.
These experts pointed her to a book by %\cite{keuchel2013generic}%.
%\citeauthor*{keuchel2013generic}% wanted to define the following data type in Coq that can be used to define the fix point of a functor.

*)

Fail Inductive FixF F := fixF : F (FixF F) -> FixF F.

(**

The type [FixF] is a generalization of [Mu] as defined in %\autoref{section:the-problem}%.
Thus, the data type [FixF] cannot be defined in Coq because the functor [F] might place its argument [FixF F] in a non-strictly positive position.
In order to be able to define this data type the functor [F] has to be restricted.
This restriction is based on the notion of containers as introduced by %\cite{abbott2003categories}%.
Mona was quite happy about the feedback because she could use the same approach to define [Free].

%\subsection*{Containers}%
%\label{subsection:containers}%

The idea of a container abstracts data types that store values.
A prominent example is the list data type.
A list can be represented by the length of the list and a function mapping positions within the list, that is, mapping natural numbers between one and the length of the list to the elements of the list.
This idea can be generalized to other data types like trees.
In this case, instead of a simple natural number, one needs a more complex data type to model all possible positions of a specific shape.

A container is given by a type [Shape] that models all possible shapes and a function [Pos] that takes a shape and yields the type of the possible positions of the given shape.
The extension of a container is the concrete data type that is modeled, that is, the extension provides a mapping of valid positions to values %\autocite{altenkirch2007generic}%.
Mona used the following implementation of a container extension in Coq.

*)

Inductive Ext Shape (Pos : Shape -> Type) A := ext : forall s, (Pos s -> A) -> Ext Shape Pos A.

(* begin hide *)
Arguments ext {_} {_} {_} s pf.
Set Implicit Arguments.
(* end hide *)
(**
%\noindent% For example, in the case of lists, the extension is the mapping of list indices to list elements.

Mona learned a lot about Coq by defining the data type [Ext].
For example, she learned that, in Coq --- in contrast to Haskell --- when a polymorphic constructor or function was applied, the type that was used as an instance was passed explicitly.
For example, the constructor [ext] was polymorphic over the type [A].
In order to apply [ext] Mona would have to pass the concrete instance for the type variable [A].
However, it was possible to persuade Coq to infer these types from the corresponding values.
Mona tweaked all constructors and functions in her Coq code so that they behaved like constructors and functions in Haskell.
For example, while [ext] would normally take five arguments in Coq --- the three types [Shape], [Pos] and [A], a shape [s : Shape] and a function of type [Pos s -> A], by tweaking it, it took only the last two arguments as a Haskell programmer would expect.

In order to understand the use of [Ext] Mona modeled the data type [One] as a container following the naming convention used by %\cite{swierstra2008data}%.
She came up with the following definition.

*)

Definition S__One := unit.

Definition P__One (s : S__One) := Void.

Definition E__One A := Ext S__One P__One A.

(**

The data type [One] was polymorphic over its type argument [A], which was used as a phantom type and,
therefore, not used on the right-hand side of the definition.
Furthermore, [One] had just one constructor that did not hold any value.
As [One] did not contain any values, the container only had a single shape without any positions.
Mona modeled the shape of [One] with the unit type.
She used the name [Shape] for the type of shapes, as in [S__One], and [Pos] for the corresponding position type.
The type of the extension of the container, which consists of the shape type [S__One] and the position function [P__One] as well as the type of the elements [A], was named [E__One].

The container extension [E__One] was isomorphic to [One].
In order to prove this property Mona defined two functions to transform these data types into one another.
She called these functions [to__One] and [from__One], respectively.

*)

Definition to__One A (e : E__One A) : One A := tt.

Definition from__One A (z : One A) : E__One A := ext tt (fun p : P__One tt => match p with end).

(**

The definition of [to__One] was straightforward as there was only a single value of type [One A].
The definition of [from__One] passed its unit value [tt] to the constructor [ext].
The second argument of [ext] was a function that could never be applied because its argument type has no inhabitants.
Therefore, the pattern matching on the position [p] could never be successful.
As the type of [p] had no inhabitants, the pattern matching did not have a right-hand side.

At last, Mona proved that [to__One] and [from__One] were actually inverse to each other and, thus, formed an isomorphism between [E__One] and [One].

*)

Lemma to_from__One : forall A (ox : One A), to__One (from__One ox) = ox.
(* begin hide *)
Proof.
  intros A ox.
  destruct ox.
  unfold from__One.

  destruct e.
  destruct s.
  unfold to__One.
  unfold from__One.
  apply f_equal.

  destruct p.
Qed.
(* end hide *)
(**

In order to define a data type that represented all free monads whose functor was a container, Mona defined a type class named [Container].
This type class was parametrized over a type constructor [F : Type -> Type] that was isomorphic to the corresponding container extension.
The type class provided the type of shapes and the mapping of a shape to the type of positions.
Furthermore, the type class provided functions [to] and [from] for transition between the functor and the corresponding container extension.
As Mona got more familiar with the advantages of Coq, the type class also provided propositions that [from] and [to] formed a bijection.

*)

Class Container F :=
  {
    Shape   : Type;
    Pos     : Shape -> Type;
    to      : forall A, Ext Shape Pos A -> F A;
    from    : forall A, F A -> Ext Shape Pos A;
    to_from : forall A (fx : F A), to (from fx) = fx;
    from_to : forall A (e : Ext Shape Pos A), from (to e) = e
  }.

(* begin hide *)
Arguments from {_} {_} {_} _.

In order to complete the example for [One], Mona defined the following instance named [C__One]%\footnote{Mona could define multiple instances for the same type in Coq, because all instances were explicitly named.}%.

Instead of using an arbitrary functor [F] the definition of [Free] used a container extension to ensure that the definition was provably valid in Coq, i.e., [Free] only occurred in strictly positive positions.
To test her definition, Mona implemented the following abbreviation.
The value [Nothing]%\footnote{She used the convention that smart constructor names started with an upper case character.}% was the value of the free monad that represented the corresponding value of the maybe monad.

When Mona continued reading about free monads, she read that for every monad there was a monad homomorphism between the instance of [Free] and the corresponding monad.
This homomorphism was often defined by means of a fold function for the [Free] data type.
One other important function on [Free] that Mona wanted to define was the function bind, which was associated with monads.
She found the following definitions of [fold] and bind on [Free] in the book by %\cite{swierstra2008data}%.

%\begin{verbatim}
    foldFree :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> (f b -> b) -> Free f a -> b
    foldFree pur imp (Pure x) = pur x
    foldFree pur imp (Impure fx) = imp (fmap (foldFree pur imp) fx)

    (>>=) :: Functor f => Free f a -> (a -> Free f b) -> Free f b
    Pure x >>= f = f x
    Impure fx >>= f = Impure (fmap (>>= f) fx)
\end{verbatim}%

Based on these definitions, Mona translated the functions to Coq, naming them [fold_free] and [>>=], respectively.

%\jump{If you are keen to know how Mona translated these functions to Coq, you and Mona can dive deeper into technical details in \autoref{app:foldbind}.
If you know how to work with recursive higher-order definitions and containers, or do not need any more details, just read ahead.}%

%\noindent% The function [fold_free] was only a means to an end.
Mona defined the function [induce], which lifts a function that maps the functor [F] to the corresponding monad [M]%\footnote{The monad \coqdocvar{M} is equipped with the functions \coqdocvar{ret} and \coqdocvar{join}.}% to a homomorphism between the free monad and the corresponding monad%\footnote{Mona had to pass the type argument \coqdocvar{M A} to the higher-ranked functional argument \coqdocvar{f} used in the application of \coqdocvar{join} because Coq was not able to infer it.}%.

To test her current setup, Mona implemented the following functions that map instances of [Free] to the identity and the maybe monad, respectively.

*)

Definition zero_to_id A (zx : Zero A) : Id A := match zx with end.

Definition free_to_id A (fx : Free C__Zero A) : Id A := induce zero_to_id fx.

Definition one_to_maybe A (ox : One A) : Maybe A := nothing.

Definition free_to_maybe A (fx : Free C__One A) : Maybe A := induce one_to_maybe fx.

(**

The functions [zero_to_id] and [one_to_maybe], respectively, map the functors [Zero] and [One] to the corresponding monads.
As there are no values of type [Zero A], Mona used an empty pattern match to get a value of type [Id A] to define [zero_to_id].

Mona was quite satisfied with her development so far, using containers she successfully defined a valid type definition for free monads in Coq.
However, Mona also realized an important point she had not considered before.
Namely, while for every monad there exists a homomorphism from a free monad to the monad, there is not necessary a function from the monad back to the free monad, such that the homomorphism forms an isomorphism with this function.
For example, as mentioned by %\cite{swierstra2008data}%, the list monad is not a free monad in the sense that the list monad is not isomorphic to an instance of the free monad.
In order to prove statements about more complex effects Mona would have to be able to model monads that were not free like the list monad.
Mona realized that she could not resort to structural equality as some values that were structurally equal in the original monad were not structurally equal in the the presentation using [Free f].
This divergence is due to the fact that the resulting representation using [Free] would inhabit more values than the original monad, if the original monad is not a free monad.
She observed, however, that she could use a custom equality for this kind of monads to solve this problem.
When proving a statement in a setting with a monad that was not a free monad, she would use a custom equality instead of using structural equality.

At first, defining this kind of custom equality felt like an involved task to Mona, because she had to compare two instances of the free monad that used a container extension as functor.
However, Mona realized that she could define the equality by means of [induce] and an equality on the original monad.
That is, in order to compare two instances of the free monad she could use the homomorphism to map these instances to the original monad and use structural equality on the monadic terms.
This way she was able to model an effect that is not free.
In a nutshell, Mona would interprete the [Free] values as their monadic representatives and compare the monadic values using structural equality.

In another round of poring over her books, Mona found an implementation by %\cite{verbruggen2008polytypic}% that uses polynomial functors to
define generic data types in Coq.
The encoding using polynomial functors represents data types as combination of four primitive constructors: unit, identity, coproduct and sum.
One disadvantage of this encoding is that many interesting data types cannot be represented: there is no possibility to represent function types at least not without running into problems concerning the strict positivity restriction, again.
In contrast, Mona found implementations of more involved effects like state using the free monad in combination with a container.%\footnote{For example, Mona found an implementation of the state monad in Agda using a free monad and containers. \url{https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/v2.4.0/README/Container/FreeMonad.agda}}%
When she studied the implementation of these effects, Mona observed that effects like state can only be encoded using function types.
She was quite astonished by the variety of monads she could model in her current setting.
Then she once again considered the continuation monad that she failed to instantiate in the beginning of her journey.
Indeed, it was still not possible to model the continuation monad using a container extension.
It was a bit of a pity for Mona that she could not represent the continuation monad, nevertheless, for now, she was content with the variety of monads that she could represent with her encoding.

* A Simple Proof

%\lettrine{T}{he}% next morning, Mona tackled the definition she struggled with in the beginning and that started this whole journey in the first place: a list with polymorphic elements and constructors with monadic components.
Instead of using a polymorphic type constructor for the monadic effect, Mona parametrized the definition of a monadic list over a container [C__F] and applied the type [Free C__F A] to the arguments of the [cons] constructor.

Mona was quite happy with her implementation of a list with monadic effects.
As a next step, she wanted to prove a property about a simple Haskell function.
First, she had to translate her Haskell program into a monadic Coq program.
Fortunately, the book by %\cite{abel2005verifying}% contained the formal definition of a transformation of Haskell programs into Agda programs.

Right now Mona did not care about a formal definition of the translation to Coq, but was more interested in reasoning about the manually transformed code in Coq.
Nevertheless she realized that the translation from Haskell to Coq was an interesting topic in itself.
For example, because programs in Coq had to terminate, the Coq termination checker had to be able to check that the monadic transformation of the program terminated.
Mona wondered whether there was a transformation that, given that a non-monadic version was accepted by the termination checker, accepted the monadic translation as well.

In order to simplify the definition of monadic programs Mona defined the following smart constructors.

%\subsection*{Induction Principle}%
%\label{subsection:verify}%

Finally, Mona had all the ingredients at hand to prove properties about Haskell functions.
As she had read the book by %\cite{abel2005verifying}% she wanted to prove the associativity of [append] as well.
In accordance with the book, she started to argue about a total world, that is, using the identity monad.

A classical proof of the associativity of append used structural induction over the argument list.
In Coq, a proof by structural induction used a lemma called induction principle that is automatically generated for each data type.
However, when Mona tried to apply the induction principle for the monadic list data type [List], it did not work as expected at first.

In a nutshell, Mona needed to define a custom induction principle for the free monad data type [Free] as well as for [List], the list data type with monadic components.
One might wonder why she needed an induction principle for the data type [Free] at all.
In the definition of the free data type at the beginning of %\autoref{section:free-monads}%, the [impure] constructor builds a stack of applications of the functor.
To reason about this stack of functor applications an induction principle was required.

%\jump{If you want to know why Mona failed to apply the induction principle, please read about all the insights she gained on induction princliples in \autoref{app:induction}.
If you already know all about nested inductive type definitions and their induction principles or do not need more details for now, just read on.}%

%\noindent% With the definitions of induction principles named [Free_Ind] and [List_Ind], respectively, at hand, Mona was eager to try her proof of the associativity of append again.


%\subsection*{Identity Monad}%
%\label{subsection:identity-monad}%

Working with Coq opened a whole new, magical world to her.
Proofs in Coq consisted of a sequence of spells called tactics.
As Mona was always eager for knowledge, she read several spell books and tried to write a proof of the associativity of [append].
All the following lemmas that Mona wanted to prove were quantified over a type, so she wrote a side-note that [A] was an arbitrary type and used [A] as an implicit parameter.

Mona started with an auxiliary lemma for [append'].
The proof of the auxiliary lemma was mostly straightforward and similar to a proof for ordinary lists.
In case of an empty list the statement was trivially true and in case of a non-empty list the statement followed from the induction hypothesis.
In order to apply the induction hypothesis Mona used the custom tactic [simplify].
The shortcut [simplify H as IH] simplified a hypothesis [H] generated by [List_Ind] and introduced the required hypothesis under the name [IH].
This slight transformation was necessary due to the custom induction principle used for [List].

  Qed.

(**
There was an odd-looking assumption in the inductive case for [Free]: a value [s] of type [S__Zero].
That is, she had a value of a type that did not have any inhabitants.
Mona realized that [s] was a false assumption; she simply had to call that bluff!
The tactic [destruct] made a case distinction on its argument; in this case it made Coq realize that the value [s] cannot exist.
This behavior actually started to make sense to Mona.
Using [Zero] meant that she was currently proving something in a total setting.
In a total setting, nothing can go wrong, so there actually was no [impure] case.

As a next step Mona proved the actual lemma that stated the associativity of [append] as follows.

In the base case of the induction over the [Free] structure Mona simply used the tactic [apply] to use the lemma she had proven before.
In the inductive case she again had a value that did not exist and, therefore, got rid of it by using [destruct].

Mona was quite content and thought that her proof was reasonably simple, however, she found it still slightly more complex than the original proof by %\citeauthor*{abel2005verifying}%.
For example, Mona had to handle the [impure] case explicitly, which does not exist when using the actual identity monad.

%\subsection*{Maybe Monad}%

As Mona was happy with the proof in the total setting, as a next step she considered a setting with partial values, that is, using [One] as container
instead of [Zero].
She expected the proofs to be similar to the ones before, as one should be able to handle the [pure] cases in the same way.
And, indeed, the proofs were nearly identical and only differed in the inductive cases for [Free].

(**

The proofs actually had to consider a potential value in the [impure] cases, because the shape [s] of the underlying container [One] is [S__One], a type that has exactly one inhabitant.
Thus, Mona could not take the easy way out relying on a false assumption again.
When she took a second close look, Mona realized that there was still something odd about the given assumptions.
Mona got rid of the constructors [Cons], [impure] and [ext] that both sides of the equality had in common by using [f_equal]%\footnote{She read that the spell \coqdoctac{f\_equal} was sometimes also called \coqdoctac{congruence} or \coqdoctac{cong} in other magical kingdoms.}% thrice.
After using [f_equal] Mona ended up with two functions.
Both functions took an argument of type [P__One s], again a type without inhabitants.

As Mona came from the kingdom of Haskell, she was used to the rule of functional extensionality.
That is, if two functions behave the same for all possible arguments, the functions are considered equal.
In Coq, two functions are equal with respect to the equality [=] if these functions evaluate to the same value or are defined in the exact same way, expression by expression, character by character modulo renaming.
If two functions just behaved the same for all possible arguments, Mona needed the axiom of functional extensionality in order to use this property in Coq.
Fortunately, this axiom is consistent with the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, that is, with the lambda calculus that is the formal basis of Coq.
After applying the rule of functional extensionality Mona had to show that the two functions behaved the same for all possible inputs.
However, as the argument type of such an input did not contain any inhabitants, there were no arguments and therefore, the statement was trivially valid.
Mona used [destruct] again to prove that there were no possible values for [p].

Mona understood that she was able to finish the proof with [destruct] because the free monad that represented the maybe monad was quite simple.
The [impure] case represented the constructor nothing and this constructor did not contain any value.

%\subsection*{Monad-Generic Proof}%

Mona was very satisfied with her solution.
Up until now, she was able to prove statements about Haskell programs when only considering total values and was also able to consider partial values.
She consulted the book by %\cite{abel2005verifying}% again and read the following paragraph.

%\begin{quote}
The reader may well wonder why we prove the same property twice, for two different monads --- why not just prove it once-and-for-all, for any monad?
While this may seem attractive in principle, it turns out to be much more difficult in practice. [...] Since Agda does not know how to compute with a general monad it will not be able to simplify the type of the properties by performing reduction steps. Thus, the only thing we can do to prove properties is to use the monad laws explicitly. Although it is possible to prove properties in this way, those proofs are both more difficult to perform and to understand, and much longer than the ones we presented above.
\end{quote}%

The scales fell from Mona's eyes.
These statements did not hold in her setting.
When using a free monad underneath, a generic proof was not that difficult anymore.
If Mona proved a statement for the free monad for an arbitrary container, the statement would hold for all monads%\footnote{With the minor restriction that the monad can be represented by a container-based instance of the free monad.}%.
As this possibility was more than Mona had originally hoped for, she immediately began to write the following monad-generic proofs.

Again these proofs basically followed the same structure.
Besides the generic parameter [C__F] for the container, once again, the only crucial differences occurred in the inductive cases for [Free].
In general, Mona could not hope for false assumptions to complete the proofs.
A more complex effect, for instance non-determinism, could actually have a recursive occurrence in the [impure] case.
In this case the induction principle for [Free] came in handy.
Mona used the induction hypothesis that said that the given statement already holds for all values that resulted from applying the position function [pf].
More precisely, the induction hypothesis provided the following statement, which states that the statement holds for lists resulting from [pf p] for all possible positions [p]. %\small%[[
forall p : Pos s, append (pf p) (append fys fzs) = append (append (pf p) fys) fzs
]]
%\normalsize%
After using functional extensionality she was able to simply apply this hypothesis by using [apply IH].
In contrast, in the case of [Zero] there was no [impure] case and in the case of [One] the [impure] case did not contain any values.
Thus, Mona did not need to use the induction hypothesis for these concrete instances.

As hard days of working through Coq tactics and these proofs passed, Mona was very pleased with her current approach.
She was even more than thrilled that using the free monad gave rise to generic proofs that hold for all monads that can be modelled using the free monad.

* A Case Study
%\label{section:case-study}%

%\lettrine{P}{roving}% a more or less trivial property for a single list function was not exactly setting the world on fire.
Thus, Mona was fierce to try her approach to prove the correctness of actual Haskell code.
Since she was helping out with some classes at the department she stayed at, she seized the opportunity to teach her approach in class.
The main topic of the class was to compare two implementations of queues.
There was a naive implementation using a single list and a more advanced implementation that used two lists to improve the performance.
In class they started with an implementation in Haskell and discussed that both concrete implementations are interchangeable with one another; the reasoning was backed up by property-based testing via QuickCheck%~\autocite{hughes2000quickcheck}%.
Mona thought that the implementations would in particular be a good example, because they contained total as well as partial functions%\footnote{In fact, Mona had also read about this example in the book by \cite{abel2005verifying}.}%.
That is, some of the statements were only valid in the context of the maybe monad, while most statements held in the total as well as in the partial setting.

%\autoref{figure:queue-implementations}% shows two different implementations of queues in
Haskell.
The implementation to the left uses a single list to model the queue.

Mona defined the following function %\texttt{toQueue}% to relate these two implementations.

In order to prove statements about the functions shown in %\autoref{figure:queue-implementations}% in Coq, Mona started to transform the data types %\texttt{Queue}% and %\texttt{QueueI}% to corresponding monadic versions.
For the definition of %\texttt{QueueI}%, she additionally needed a monadic version of pairs.
The data type %\texttt{Queue}% is just a type synonym for a list, which can be defined in Coq as a type synonym as well.

The functions [front] and [frontI] were partially defined because the cases for the empty list were missing in these definitions.
That is, when modeling these functions in Coq, Mona had to use the maybe instance.
Mona only considered the implementation of [front] as the definition of [frontI] followed the same idea.
Moreover, she defined the Coq version of %\texttt{toQueue}% to relate both implementations.
The transformations of all other functions to Coq were straightforward and followed the approach used for [append].

(**

In class Mona discussed the QuickCheck properties given in the right column in %\autoref{figure:queue-implementations}%.
The operator %\texttt{==>}% took a boolean expression that was checked as a precondition for the test case.
The function %\texttt{invariant}% stated an invariant about the %\texttt{QueueI}% implementation, namely, that the back end of the queue would be empty whenever the front end was empty.
In other words, either the back end was empty or the front end was not empty.
This property was checked by the following predicate on queues.

<<
    invariant :: QueueI a -> Bool
    invariant (f,b) = null b || not (null f)
>>

When writing test cases in QuickCheck, the programmer usually considers total values only.
Therefore, Mona extended the invariant with the requirement that all queues that are checked are total using
the proposition [total_list].
While Mona used the maybe instance as model, she did not define [total_list] for the special case of the maybe monad, but generalized it to an arbitrary effect.
That is, while she still named the predicate [total_list], it rather checked whether the list was effect-free.

 *)

  Inductive total_list A : Free C__F (List C__F A) -> Prop :=
  | total_nil : total_list (pure nil)
  | total_cons : forall fx fxs, total_list fxs -> total_list (pure (cons fx fxs)).

(**

The definition needed to distinguish between two cases.
First, a defined empty list was total, that is, [pure nil] was total.
Second, a defined non-empty list [pure (cons fx fxs)] was total if the tail [fxs] was total as well.
The proposition did not check whether the element [fx] was defined, that is, whether it had the form [pure x].

Since Mona wanted to work with properties about [QueueI]s, she extended the definition to check both list components of a queue.
The functions [fst] and [snd] projected to the components of a pair lifted into the free monad.

Since the QuickCheck properties all used premises whose type is [Free C__F bool], Mona defined a smart constructor [(===>)] to lift these [Free C__F bool] values into properties.

First Mona showed the class a proof of a property that was specific to the maybe monad.
The property was specific to the maybe monad because it made use of the partial function [front].
The property stated that [frontI] yields the same result as a combination of [front] and [toQueue] under the precondition that the queue fulfilled the invariant and was not empty.
Mona explained the students that all the following proofs assumed [A] to be an arbitrary type, that is, [A] was used but not explicitly introduced in the code she wrote.

After all proofs were done, one of Mona's students complained about the definition of [front].
For the sake of the user, the function [front] should yield an error that explained the problem instead of simply raising a generic non-exhaustive patterns error.
As her student's wish was her command, she implemented the following variant of [front] in Haskell.
<<
  front :: Queue a -> a
  front (x:f,b) = x
  front _ = error "front: empty queue"
>>

One of the other students now complained that they had to do all the nice proofs again but using the functor [Const] instead of [One].
Mona appeased them by pointing out that they only had to do the maybe-specific proofs like [prop_front] again, but not all the monad-generic proofs like [prop_isEmpty] and [prop_add].
That is, they only had to redo proofs that talked about function definitions that actually changed.
In fact it all fit together quite nicely.
For example, as the predicate [total_list] checked whether a list was effect-free, Mona reused it in the case of the error effect and it specified exactly what one was looking for: a list without errors.

* The End

%\lettrine{H}{appy}% with her results, Mona headed back home to the kingdom of Haskell the next week.
She had learned a lot about proving properties of Haskell programs.
Well-known concepts like monadic transformations of data types, containers and free monads were the foundations of her solution.
The combination of all of these ideas led to a new approach to model and prove properties about effectful programs in Coq.
Even more importantly, while %\cite{abel2005verifying}% thought it difficult to prove monad-generic statements, Mona had discovered that it was not that difficult after all.
She was able to prove statements using an arbitrary effect represented using the free monad, whose functor is a container.

Mona really looked forward to continue pursuing her PhD because there were so many questions she would like to have an answer to.
For now she only considered the effect of partiality, while her proofs held for arbitrary effects.
For example, using her approach she could model lazy tracing as provided by the function [trace] by means of a simple reader monad.
The best news about her current setup was that all the monad-generic proofs would still hold in this setting.

Besides extending her simple model of Haskell with more advanced effects, Mona planned to use her setting to model other programming languages.
For example, a functional logic programming language like Curry can be modeled by the same transformation as shown by %\cite{fischer2009purely}%.
This model uses a non-determinism monad instead of the partiality monad.
Mona also planned to investigate modeling a probabilistic programming language as she read that functional logic and probabilistic programming are closely related in a book by %\cite{dylus2018probabilistic}%.

When Mona looked into effects like non-determinism, she observed that there were some additional requirements.
While the free monad extends a functor [f] with an additional structure to define the functions [ret] and [bind], the free monad provides exactly this structure only.
However, some monads provide more structure than given by a free monad.
Mona thought about the list monad again, which was not a free monad and needed a custom equality in her setting as discussed in %\autoref{subsection:freeCoq}%.
In order to prove statements that rely on additional properties of a concrete monad, Mona could not resort to structural equality, she would have to define a custom equality.
However, defining custom equalities for free monads by means of the corresponding monad homomorphism is straightforward.
Furthermore, monad-generic proofs can also be reused in a setting with a custom equality because terms that are definitional equal are also equal with respect to a custom equality.

Thinking about different effects raised the question if the translation of programs had to be adapted.
Mona's current translation was based on the optimized version by %\cite{abel2005verifying}%, where partiality was the only effect that could occur.
In this case a function [f] of type [tau -> tau'] could be modeled by a Coq function of type [M tau -> M tau'].
However, in a more general setting, Mona had to use a function of type [M (M tau -> M tau')] instead.
For example, if [seq] is available, one can observe whether a function [f] is defined as [undefined] or as [fun x -> undefined].
For instance, the expression [seq f 42] fails in the former case, but yields [42] in the latter case.

Using function types of the form [M (M tau -> M tau')] is in particular important, when modeling a functional logic language.
For example, some free theorems fail in the context of functional logic languages due to the difference between a non–deterministic choice of two functions and a function that yields two non-deterministic results as shown by %\cite{christiansen2010free}% and elaborated by %\cite{mehner2014parametricity}%.
Mona wanted to use her framework for a variety of effects, thus, the optimized translation of function types used by %\cite{abel2005verifying}% was not applicable anymore.

Finally, Mona wondered about a more direct modeling of strictly positive monads.
Currently, she used a free monad whose functor is a container.
Instead she could as well use only a container.
For example, the identity and the maybe monad can be modeled as containers.
That is, she could use container monads as discussed by %\cite{uustalu2017container}%, which model containers that provide a monadic structure.
This way she could even model the list monad without using a custom equality.
However, when using container monads directly Mona could only reason about monadic programs using monad laws.
%\cite{abel2005verifying}% did not consider monad-generic proofs because they had to resort to monad laws.
In contrast, Mona's current approach using free monads enabled Coq to compute with a general monad and simplify properties by reduction.

As Mona knew that a successful PhD student would interest her peers in her results, she started to spread the word about her work.
In order to practice her writing skills, she also wrote a short story about her journey through the land of functional programming.
Mona continued to pursue her PhD and lived happily ever after.

(** * A Trip to the Technical Corners of the Land of Dependently Typed Programming

%\label{appendix}%

%\subsection{Definition of fold and bind}%
%\label{app:foldbind}%

Mona wanted to translate the Haskell definition of the functions fold and bind on [Free] she found in the book by %\cite{swierstra2008data}%.
She started with fold as it looked like the easier task.

<<
    foldFree :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> (f b -> b) -> Free f a -> b
    foldFree pur imp (Pure x) = pur x
    foldFree pur imp (Impure fx) = imp (fmap (foldFree pur imp) fx)
>>

%\noindent% In contrast to %\citeauthor*{swierstra2008data}%, Mona worked on a container representation that she had to transform into the corresponding functor using [to] first in order to use [fmap].
However, instead of using the function [fmap] she could use a concrete mapping function [cmap] on [Ext] directly.
This way she could get rid of the additional [Functor] constraint.

Mona defined the following map function for the container [C__F], where [Shape] and [Pos] are the types associated with the container.
[[
  Definition cmap A B (f : A -> B) (x : Ext Shape Pos A) : Ext Shape Pos B :=
    match x with
    | ext s pf => ext s (fun x => f (pf x))
    end.
]]

%\noindent% Based on the definition of [cmap], she implemented the following recursive function to fold [Free] expressions.
As the function [imp] worked on arguments of type [F B], Mona applied the function [to] on the argument of [imp] to transform the container representation into the concrete structure [F].
[[
  Fixpoint fold_free A B (pur : A -> B) (imp : F B -> B) (fx : Free C__F A) : B :=
    match fx with
    | pure x => pur x
    | impure e => imp (to (cmap (fold_free pur imp) e))
    end.
]]

%\noindent% Besides the special handling of the container construction, the translation was quite straightforward.
Next up, Mona took another look at the Haskell definition of the bind operator for [Free].
%
\begin{verbatim}
    (>>=) :: Functor f => Free f a -> (a -> Free f b) -> Free f b
    Pure x >>= f = f x
    Impure fx >>= f = Impure (fmap (>>= f) fx)
\end{verbatim}
%

%\noindent% For her translation to Coq, she did not need to use [fmap], as above, but the auxiliary function [cmap].
Otherwise the two definitions looked quite alike.
[[
  Fixpoint free_bind A B (fx : Free C__F A) (f : A -> Free C__F B) : Free C__F B :=
    match fx with
    | pure x => f x
    | impure e => impure (cmap (fun x => free_bind x f) e)
    end.
]]
Only later, Mona realized that the definition caused problems.
When she tried to define recursive functions that use [free_bind], Coq's termination checker nagged about most of her programs.

As Mona studied a lot of Coq code during her journey, she remembered that recursive functions were often defined using so-called [Section]s.
For example, the standard library for lists in Coq follows the same approach to define functions like [map], [fold_right] and [fold_left].
She changed her code as follows.
[[
  Section fbind.

    Variable A B: Type.
    Variable f: A -> Free C__F B.

    Fixpoint free_bind' (ffA: Free C__F A) :=
      match ffA with
      | pure x => f x
      | impure (ext s pf) => impure (ext s (fun p => free_bind' (pf p)))
      end.

  End fbind.
]]

%\noindent% At the start of the section Mona introduced all variables annotated with their types that would be used throughout the
section.
All definitions in this section take these variables as additional arguments when used outside of the section.
That is, within the section the function [free_bind'] had the type [Free C__F A -> Free C__F B], whereas it had the type [(A -> Free C__F B) -> Free C__F A -> Free C__F B] outside of the section.
That is, within the section the only remaining argument of [free_bind'] was the inductive argument that was decreasing: the [Free] structure [ffA].
Mona read that it was crucial to define the function [f] as a section variable in order to signalize Coq's termination checker that the function [f] never changed in any recursive call.
Furthermore, Mona defined the operator [>>=] based on [free_bind'], but with arguments swapped.

%\subsection{Nested Recursive Function Definitions}%
%\label{app:nested}%

As the [Free] data type was a monad, Mona wanted to define [append] quite naturally using monadic notation as follows.

 *)
(* begin hide *)
Section ListAppendix.

  Variable F : Type -> Type.
  Variable C__F : Container F.
(* end hide *)

  Fail Fixpoint append A (fxs fys : Free C__F (List C__F A)) : Free C__F (List C__F A) :=
    fxs >>= fun xs => match xs with
                  | nil => fys
                  | cons fz fzs => Cons fz (append fzs fys)
                  end.

(**
%\noindent% Unfortunately, Coq did not accept this definition of [append] because the termination checker was not able to guess the decreasing argument.
However, Coq's termination checker accepted the following definition that was based on a helper function.
%\small% [[
  Fixpoint append' A (xs: List C__F A) (fys: Free C__F (List C__F A)) : Free C__F (List C__F A) :=
    match xs with
    | nil => fys
    | cons fz fzs => Cons fz (fzs >>= fun zs => append' zs fys)
    end.

  Definition append A (fxs: Free C__F (List C__F A)) (fys: Free C__F (List C__F A)) : Free C__F (List C__F A) :=
    fxs >>= fun xs => append' xs fys.
]]
%\normalsize%

Mona discovered that she could please Coq's termination checker by splitting the definition into two parts: a recursive function [append'] that had an argument of type [List A] and a non-recursive function [append] that called [append'] after unwrapping the monadic effect.

The main problem with Mona's original definition was that [List A] was a nested inductive type, [Free (List A)] occurred nested in [List A].
That is, to define a recursive function, Mona had to use nested recursion in the definition of [append'] as she had read about in the book by %\cite{chlipala2011certified}%.
More precisely, the function [append'] was nested recursive because [>>=] was recursive and used nested in [append].
In the second branch of [append'] she had to inline the definition of [append] in order to resemble the nested recursive structure of the [List A] data type.

%\subsection{Induction Principles}%
%\label{app:induction}%

In order to understand what exactly was going on, Mona took some time for getting a better understanding of some technicalities of the programming language Coq.
She started to look at the induction principle for [nat] in Coq.%\footnote{The command \coqdocvar{Check nat\_ind} prints the type of the induction principle \coqdocvar{nat\_ind}.}%%\small%[[
  nat_ind : forall P : nat -> Prop,
    P 0
    -> (forall m : nat, P m -> P (S m))
    -> forall n : nat, P n
]]
%\normalsize%
%\noindent% A proposition [P n] holds for all [n : nat], if [P] holds for [0] and, for all [m : nat], [P] holds for [S m] given that it already holds for [m].
For all [m : nat] the proposition [P m] is called the induction hypothesis.

Next, Mona took a look at the induction principle that was generated for the monadic list type [List]%\footnote{Coq generates an induction principle called \coqdocvar{List\_ind} for a data type called \coqdocvar{List}.}%.%\small%[[
  List_ind : forall (A : Type) (P : List C__F A -> Prop),
    P (nil C__F A)
    -> (forall (fx : Free C__F A) (fxs : Free C__F (List C__F A)), P (cons fx fxs))
    -> forall (l : List C__F A), P l
]]
%\normalsize%
%\noindent% This induction principle was supposed to be quite similar to the induction principle for Peano numbers.
However, while there was a base case for the empty list, that is [P (nil C__F A)], the induction principle demanded that the proposition held for the non-empty list, that is [P (cons fx fxs)], without having an induction hypothesis for [fxs].

In order to prove a statement about [List], Mona also needed an induction principle for [Free].
When Mona checked the induction principle for [Free], it showed the same problem as the induction principle for [List].
She would have to prove [P (impure e)] without knowing anything about [e].%\small%[[
  Free_ind : forall (A : Type) (P : Free C__F A -> Prop),
    (forall x : A, P (pure x))
    -> (forall e : Ext Shape Pos (Free C__F A), P (impure e))
    -> forall (fx : Free C__F A), P fx
]]
%\normalsize%
%\noindent% After some research Mona found a chapter in %\citeauthor{chlipala2011certified}%'s book that explained how to define induction principles that fit one's purpose.
The chapter also stated that the induction principles of nested data types generated by Coq are too weak (most of the time).
Now all Mona had to do was to define her own induction principle for [List] and [Free].
Since [Free] is used nested in [List], Mona started with [Free].

Mona modified the type of [Free_ind] in order to fit her purposes and named the new induction principle [Free_Ind].
She only had to modify the last argument of [Free_ind] that handled the [impure] case.
In the [impure] case, she had a value [e : Ext Shape Pos (Free A)], that is, a container extension with two components [s : Shape] and [pf : Pos s -> Free A].
Intuitively the [impure] constructor contains a container extension of values of type [Free A].
Obviously, Mona needed the proposition [P] to hold for all elements of the container extension.
Therefore, she added the requirement that every [Free A] that can be produced by the position function [pf : Pos s -> Free A] satisfied proposition [P].
If that was the case, then [P] held for [impure (ext s pf)].
Mona made the following changes.%\small%[[
  Free_Ind : . . .
    . . .
    -> (forall (s : Shape) (pf : Pos s -> Free C__F A), (forall p, P (pf p)) -> P (impure (ext s pf)))
    . . .
]]
%\normalsize%
Finally, Mona had to provide a function of the type of [Free_Ind].
Mona thought that the puzzle pieces fitted together quite naturally when she defined the following function via pattern matching on [fx : Free A]. %\small% [[
  Fixpoint Free_Ind A (P : Free C__F A -> Prop)
      (pur : forall (x : A), P (pure x))
      (imp : forall (s : Shape) (pf : Pos s -> Free C__F A), (forall p, P (pf p)) -> P (impure (ext s pf)))
      (fx : Free C__F A) : P fx :=
    match fx with
    | pure x => pur x
    | impure (ext s pf) => imp s pf (fun p : Pos s => Free_Ind P pur imp (pf p))
    end.

In case of [pure x], Mona had to provide a term of type [P (pure x)] and constructed it by applying the function [pur] to [x].
For [impure (ext s pf)], the function [imp] came in handy.
As first two arguments Mona used the arguments [s] and [pf]; as third argument she needed a proof that the proposition [P] already held for [pf p] for all appropriate positions [p], that is, an expression of type [(p : Pos s) -> P (pf p)].
The induction principle [Free_Ind] had type [(f x : Free A) -> P fx] and, thus, matched the required type when Mona applied [pf] to a given position [p].
The other arguments used in the application of [Free_Ind] are the proposition [P] as well as the hypotheses [pur] and [imp] that remained unchanged.

Based on her new knowledge about the definition of induction principles and the example in %\citeauthor*{chlipala2011certified}%'s book %\autocite{chlipala2011certified}%, Mona also successfully defined an induction principle [List_Ind] for the data type [List].
Mona used induction for ordinary lists all the time.
In the base case, the statement had to be proven for the empty list.
For a non-empty list [cons x xs] there was a hypothesis in place that said that the statement already hold for [xs].
In the definition of [List] both arguments of [Cons] were wrapped in [Free], such that Coq did not generate any hypotheses for the remaining list in the induction principle presented earlier. %\small%[[
  List_ind : forall (A : Type) (P : List C__F A -> Prop),
    P (nil C__F A)
    -> (forall (fx : Free C__F A) (fxs : Free C__F (List C__F A)), P (cons fx fxs))
    -> forall (l : List C__F A), P l

The same problem occurs when an induction principle is generated for an arbitrary data structure [DT] that contains a list of [DT] as argument in one of its constructors.
In the case of nested lists, an additional property is commonly used to lift propositions for [A] to lists of [A], that is, to state that the property holds for all elements of a list.
Mona applied this idea and defined the following proposition [ForFree] that lifted a proposition for [A] to [Free A].%\small%[[
  Inductive ForFree A (P : A -> Prop) : Free C__F A -> Prop :=
  | For_pure : forall x : A, P x -> ForFree P (pure x)
  | For_impure : forall (s : Shape) (pf : Pos s -> Free C__F A),
      (forall p : Pos s, ForFree P (pf p)) -> ForFree P (impure (ext s pf))

For a given proposition [P : A -> Prop] Mona distinguished two cases.
In case of [pure x] the proposition was valid if [P x] held.
For [impure (ext s pf)] the proposition was valid if [P] held for all elements of the container [ext s pf].
To state that [P] held for all elements of the container [ext s pf] Mona used the same idea as for the definition of [Free_Ind].

With the definition of [ForFree] at hand, she defined the induction principle [List_Ind] that used a hypothesis about the remaining list in the [cons] case.%\small%[[
  List_Ind : . . .
    . . .
    -> (forall (fx : Free C__F A) (fxs : Free (List C__F A)), ForFree P fxs -> P (cons fx fxs))
    . . .

One detail Mona did not like about these definitions was that the induction hypothesis generated by [List_Ind] seemed so complicated to use.
The hypothesis was of the form [H : ForFree P (pure xs)], where [P] was the statement Mona needed to conclude the proof.
She could derive from the definition of [ForFree] that [P] held for [xs], but she had to apply a lot of tactics to get access to that hypothesis.
In order to make the usage of [List_Ind] more convenient, Mona wrote a shortcut that brought the induction hypothesis into the required form and could also handle such a hypothesis for the [impure] case.
The shortcut [simplify H as IH] simplified a hypothesis [H] generated by [List_Ind] and introduced the required hypothesis under the name [IH].
